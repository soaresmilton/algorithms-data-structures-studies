# Daily Byte Problems


### Day 1 - Reverse Strings
This question is asked by Google. Given a string, reverse all of its characters and return the resulting string.
Ex: Given the following strings...
> “Cat”, return “taC” 
> 
> “The Daily Byte”, return "etyB yliaD ehT”
> 
> “civic”, return “civic”

### Day 2 - Valid Palindrome
This question is asked by Facebook. Given a string, return whether or not it forms a palindrome ignoring case and non-alphabetical characters.
Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.


Ex: Given the following strings...


> "level", return true
> 
> "algorithm", return false
> 
> "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.", return true

### Day 3 - Vacuum Cleaner Route
This question is asked by Amazon. Given a string representing the sequence of moves a robot vacuum makes, return whether or not it will return to its original position. The string will only contain L, R, U, and D characters, representing left, right, up, and down respectively.

Ex: Given the following strings...

>"LR", return true
>
>"URURD", return false
>
>"RUULLDRD", return true
