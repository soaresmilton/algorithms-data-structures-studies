# Daily Byte Problems


### Day 1 - Reverse Strings
This question is asked by Google. Given a string, reverse all of its characters and return the resulting string.
Ex: Given the following strings...
> “Cat”, return “taC” 
> 
> “The Daily Byte”, return "etyB yliaD ehT”
> 
> “civic”, return “civic”

### Day 2 - Valid Palindrome
This question is asked by Facebook. Given a string, return whether or not it forms a palindrome ignoring case and non-alphabetical characters.
Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.


Ex: Given the following strings...


> "level", return true
> 
> "algorithm", return false
> 
> "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.", return true

### Day 3 - Vacuum Cleaner Route
This question is asked by Amazon. Given a string representing the sequence of moves a robot vacuum makes, return whether or not it will return to its original position. The string will only contain L, R, U, and D characters, representing left, right, up, and down respectively.

Ex: Given the following strings...

>"LR", return true
>
>"URURD", return false
>
>"RUULLDRD", return true

### Day 4 - Correct Capitalization

This question is asked by Google. Given a string, return whether or not it uses capitalization correctly. A string correctly uses capitalization if all letters are capitalized, no letters are capitalized, or only the first letter is capitalized.

Ex: Given the following strings...

>"USA", return true
> 
> "Calvin", return true
> 
> "compUter", return false
> 
> "coding", return true

### Day 5 - Add Binary

This question is asked by Apple. Given two binary strings (strings containing only 1s and 0s) return their sum (also as a binary string).
Note: neither binary string will contain leading 0s unless the string itself is 0

Ex: Given the following binary strings...

> "100" + "1", return "101"
> 
> "11" + "1", return "100"
> 
> "1" + "0", return  "1

[See my approach for this problem here](addBinary.js)

### Day 6 - Longest Commom Prefix

This question is asked by Microsoft. Given an array of strings, return the longest common prefix that is shared amongst all strings.

Note: you may assume all strings only contain lowercase alphabetical characters.

Ex: Given the following arrays...


>["colorado", "color", "cold"], return "col"
>
>["a", "b", "c"], return ""
>
>["spot", "spotty", "spotted"], return "spot"
