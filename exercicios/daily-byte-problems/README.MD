# Daily Byte Problems
Exercícios recebidos diariamente via e-mail pela newsletter do pessoal [Daily Byte](https://thedailybyte.dev/))

### Day 1 - Reverse Strings
This question is asked by Google. Given a string, reverse all of its characters and return the resulting string.
Ex: Given the following strings...
> “Cat”, return “taC” 
> 
> “The Daily Byte”, return "etyB yliaD ehT”
> 
> “civic”, return “civic”

[See my approach for this problem here](reverse-string.js)

### Day 2 - Valid Palindrome
This question is asked by Facebook. Given a string, return whether or not it forms a palindrome ignoring case and non-alphabetical characters.
Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.


Ex: Given the following strings...


> "level", return true
> 
> "algorithm", return false
> 
> "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.", return true

### Day 3 - Vacuum Cleaner Route
This question is asked by Amazon. Given a string representing the sequence of moves a robot vacuum makes, return whether or not it will return to its original position. The string will only contain L, R, U, and D characters, representing left, right, up, and down respectively.

Ex: Given the following strings...

>"LR", return true
>
>"URURD", return false
>
>"RUULLDRD", return true

### Day 4 - Correct Capitalization

This question is asked by Google. Given a string, return whether or not it uses capitalization correctly. A string correctly uses capitalization if all letters are capitalized, no letters are capitalized, or only the first letter is capitalized.

Ex: Given the following strings...

>"USA", return true
> 
> "Calvin", return true
> 
> "compUter", return false
> 
> "coding", return true

### Day 5 - Add Binary

This question is asked by Apple. Given two binary strings (strings containing only 1s and 0s) return their sum (also as a binary string).
Note: neither binary string will contain leading 0s unless the string itself is 0

Ex: Given the following binary strings...

> "100" + "1", return "101"
> 
> "11" + "1", return "100"
> 
> "1" + "0", return  "1

[See my approach for this problem here](addBinary.js)

### Day 6 - Longest Commom Prefix

This question is asked by Microsoft. Given an array of strings, return the longest common prefix that is shared amongst all strings.

Note: you may assume all strings only contain lowercase alphabetical characters.

Ex: Given the following arrays...


>["colorado", "color", "cold"], return "col"
>
>["a", "b", "c"], return ""
>
>["spot", "spotty", "spotted"], return "spot"

### Day 7 - Two Sum

This question is asked by Google. Given an array of integers, return whether or not two numbers sum to a given target, k.
Note: you may not sum a number with itself.

Ex: Given the following...

>[1, 3, 8, 2], k = 10, return true (8 + 2)
>
>[3, 9, 13, 7], k = 8, return false
>
>[4, 2, 6, 5, 2], k = 4, return true (2 + 2)

[See my approach for this problem here](twoSum.js)

## Day 8 - Jewels and Stones

This question is asked by Amazon. Given a string representing your stones and another string representing a list of jewels, return the number of stones that you have that are also jewels.

Ex: Given the following jewels and stones...


>jewels = "abc", stones = "ac", return 2
>
>jewels = "Af", stones = "AaaddfFf", return 3
>
>jewels = "AYOPD", stones = "ayopd", return 0

[See my approach for this problem here](jewelsStones.js)

 ---
### Day 9 - Valid Anagram

This question is asked by Facebook. Given two strings s and t return whether or not s is an anagram of t.
Note: An anagram is a word formed by reordering the letters of another word.

Ex: Given the following strings...


>s = "cat", t = "tac", return true
>
>s = "listen", t = "silent", return true
>
>s = "program", t = "function", return false

[See my approach for this problem here](validAnagram.js)

### Day 10 - First Unique Character

This question is asked by Microsoft. Given a string, return the index of its first unique character. If a unique character does not exist, return -1.

Ex: Given the following strings...

>"abcabd", return 2
>
>"thedailybyte", return 1
>
>"developer", return 0
